# Medieval Marketplace #

This map set was put together to be used with virtual meeting platform Gather (http://gather.town). If you use these maps, you must include the art credits somewhere in the village. See the "museum cards" folder for nice cards you can attach to the statuary in the stone building.

To use with Gather:

1. Navigate to http://gather.town and click "Create Space". Select "Blank" and "Start from scratch" on the next page, then click "Create Space". 
2. You will be loaded in to an empty map and it will alert you that you might be trapped. Ignore that and click on the Gear icon in the toolbar at the bottom of the window, then click "Edit Map". 
3. A new browser window or tab will open and load the map maker. There are three icons in the upper right: Upload Background, Upload Foreground, and Share Map. 
   a. Upload the main market map using the Upload Background button.
   b. Upload the foreground using the Upload Foreground button.
4. In the upper left is a row of icons: menu, canvas mover, Select mode, tile mode, object mode, and erase mode.
   a. Using tile mode (spawn) with erase mode active, click on the bright green square in the upper left corner of the map.
   b. Using the Canvas Mover, click and drag the canvas until you see the village decorations. You'll begin in the upper left corner of the map, so your dragging your mouse from right to left and down to up (swipe left and swipe up).
   c. Set all fences and anything people should not be able to walk over top of (buildings, signs, the well, market stalls, etc) to impassable. A red tint will appear anywhere this marking is placed. The merchant wagons have foreground elements in the row of tiles where the open window is to allow merchants to "enter" the wagons and stand in the window, so don't block those off. You may need to save your progress and test things out in the regular Gather environment. The houses and museum have roof tiles in the foreground image so users appear to walk behind them if in the same tile space, so you can also leave the roofs (outside of the fences and/or on the road tiles) unblocked.
   d. Set a few spawn tiles where you would like visitors to spawn in. A recommended spot is at the very bottom center, on the road tiles.
   e. When setting private space tile (for example: merchant booths), each separate private space can have multiple tiles assigned to it and they are grouped together by setting the ID in the right-hand column. All private space tiles assigned the same ID will be part of the same private space, even if they aren't adjacent to one another.
   f. The building interiors are separate maps and can either be added as rooms to your current space or uploaded to separate spaces. Once you have an interior's maps loaded up, you can use the portal tile to link the two entrances together. You must do this twice - once for entering an interior space, and once to exit the interior. Each time you click a tile with the portal tile tool, it will ask you where to place the destination. Select the appropriate room and Map Maker will load it so you can select where in the room users should land. The interior room maps are large and full of void space for a reason - so that the entrances align and you can easily do portal tile linking. If you are portaling to a separate space, you will not be asked to set the destination tile - Gather will send your users either to that room's spawn tiles or to the last space they were when they left.
5. If you are having actual merchants participate, you can attach an image, video-link, or embedded website object to any tile. 
   a. Move the map so the spot you'll place your object is visible, and switch to Object mode.
   b. In the objects list, select the gray circle with the + symbol to add a custom object.
   c. In the dialog box, open the "create new" tab and scroll until you see "blank" and "blank (2x2)". 
   d. Select either one, depending on the size you want. 
   e. Select which interaction you need. "External Call" is for links to videoconference rooms - this is great for getting people to classes and talks.
   f. The next dialog has settings specific to the interaction you've chosen. 
      i. Advanced Options has Activation distance (how far away someone can be and still see the preview or activate the interaction), an optional blurb, and object scheduling if your interaction is time-sensitive.
   g. When you're ready, click the blue "Place Object" button and click where it should be placed. 
   h. You can access properties for previously placed "invisible" objects or find if a tile already has any set by using the select mode tool and clicking on a tile.
6. Once you are done, save your changes. You can then close the Map Maker tab and return to the live space to see your changes. If you change the map while other users are present, they may need to reload (F5) or respawn (in the Gear menu).
