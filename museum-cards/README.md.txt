# Museum Cards #

These are for the medieval village museum - attach a different card to each piece of statuary in the museum, set interaction distance to 1 (because it's tight in there), and voila! You have artist credits done in a way that people might actually look at while they're there.

Artist credits are required to be included in any project that uses the component tilesets, as a condition of the individual licenses.
